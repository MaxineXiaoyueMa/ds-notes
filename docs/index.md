# Welcome to Xiaoyue's Notes!

This is an ever expanding collection of notes on **data science, machine learning, deep learning, and artifical intelligence**.

I immensely enjoy the open source culture fostered in this field, and have learned almost everything from courses, communities, tutorials, and articles hosted online. To pay it forward, here are my two cents!

Hope you find something useful, interesting, and/or fun here, feel free to reach out!
